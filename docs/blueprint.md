# **App Name**: GeoSearch

## Core Features:

- Map Display: Display a map using Leaflet, centered on the user's location or a default location if geolocation fails.
- Location Search Input: Implement a search input field to allow users to enter a location.
- Search Trigger: Display a search icon to trigger the search action when clicked or when Enter is pressed.
- Handle Search Query: Handle the search query by logging the search term and displaying a basic alert as a placeholder. This can be expanded with a proper integration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7EC4CF) to evoke a sense of calm and trustworthiness, referencing the vastness of the ocean and sky often associated with maps.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) as a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that doesn't distract from the map or search input.
- Accent color: Light green (#A8E6CF) to highlight interactive elements and call to action, providing a fresh contrast to the blue tones.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to balance a modern look and a touch of warmth and personality
- Simple, outlined icons for the search trigger and map elements, ensuring clarity and a minimalist aesthetic.
- Split-screen layout with the map taking up one half and the search form on the other, optimized for desktop viewing.
- Smooth transitions for map interactions and search animations to improve user engagement and provide a polished feel.
